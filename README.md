# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

B.Sc. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Computer & Information Sciences from the American University of Armenia, and a graduate of 42 Yerevan Programming School.  
I combine theoretical foundations with hands-on experience in development and computational problem-solving.  
I like to think of myself as someone who codes not just to make things work, but to make them work efficiently.

## 👨‍💻 Interest Areas

- Geospatial Data Science  
- Bioinformatics  
- Back-End Development  
- High-Performance Algorithms & Distributed Systems  

Good theoretical foundation in Mathematics, Algorithms, Databases, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Cryptography, and Cybersecurity.
In other words: I know where the rabbit holes are, and I’m willing to dive.
