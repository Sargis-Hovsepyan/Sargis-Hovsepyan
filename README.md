## 🛠️Programming Languages and Tools

I started with learning C ✨. It is an amazing language that I have been learning more than a year in 42Yerevan.
Currently I am trying to learn C++ 🔥, which is another awesome beast. I guess C++ will advance my skills to a
newer level and enrich my experience 💫. I am also familiar with Java ☕and trying to deepen my knowledeg in 
Java backend development. I also want to specielise in DevOps Engineering.
